# Smart-Fault-Detector 

##  Project Description
The **Smart-Fault-Detector** is a specialized diagnostic device engineered to detect actuator faults and failures in high-stakes systems like rockets and robotics. By monitoring the "pulse" of an actuator through electrical and mechanical sensors, it identifies anomalies before they lead to catastrophic system failure.
