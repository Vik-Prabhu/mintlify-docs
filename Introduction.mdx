# Smart-Fault-Detector 

##  Project Description
The **Smart-Fault-Detector** is a specialized diagnostic device engineered to detect actuator faults and failures in high-stakes systems like rockets and robotics. By monitoring the "pulse" of an actuator through electrical and mechanical sensors, it identifies anomalies before they lead to catastrophic system failure.

##  Overview
This system provides a comprehensive health-check for actuators. It tracks electrical parameters, mechanical rotation, and structural vibrations to create a "digital twin" of the actuator's performance.

##  Hardware Architecture

The system is built around the **GLYPH-C3 (ESP32-C3)** microcontroller. The architecture is divided into modular blocks for power management, sensing, and user interface.

### Core Components
* **MCU:** GLYPH-C3 (ESP32-C3) RISC-V microcontroller.
* **Power:** Integrated **LM2596** buck converter providing stable 5V and 3.3V rails from a +12V source.
* **Safety:** Features a physical **KillSwitch** and status LED indicators.
* **User Interface:** I2C-connected **OLED Display** for real-time status.
