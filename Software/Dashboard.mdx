description: Technical overview of the Flask-based IoT Fault Detector Web Server
---

## 1. System Architecture

The server operates on a "Push-Stream" model to ensure low-latency data visualization.



* **Ingestion**: The hardware (ESP32) sends a JSON payload to the `/update` endpoint via HTTP POST.
* **Broadcasting**: The server emits a `sensor_update` event to all connected web clients via SocketIO.
* **Visualization**: The browser receives the data and updates the charts and health indicators dynamically.

## 2. Development Setup


### Backend Dependencies:

The backend is built on the Python ecosystem. These packages manage the web server, API routing, and real-time data broadcasting.

* **Flask**: The core micro-framework used for web routing and serving the HTML interface.
* **Flask-SocketIO**: Enables low-latency, bi-directional communication between the server and the dashboard via WebSockets.
* **eventlet or gevent**: (Recommended) High-concurrency libraries often used as the underlying server for SocketIO.

#### Installation:
You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio
```
