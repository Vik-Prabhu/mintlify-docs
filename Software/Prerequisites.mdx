## Prerequisites

Before you begin coding for the **glyphC3**, you must configure your development environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### 1. Environment Setup
Follow the complete guide below to set up the Arduino IDE and configure the ESP32-C3 board package:
* **[glyphC3 Arduino IDE Setup Guide](https://learn.pcbcupid.com/boards/needs/arduino-ide-setup)**

### 2. Library Installation
Open the **Library Manager** in the Arduino IDE (*Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries*) and install the following:

* **ArduinoJson** (by Benoit Blanchon)
* **Adafruit SSD1306** (by Adafruit)
* **Adafruit GFX Library** (by Adafruit)

> [!TIP]
> Libraries such as `WiFi.h`, `HTTPClient.h`, `SPI.h`, `SD.h`, and `Wire.h` are part of the ESP32 core and are installed automatically when you follow the setup guide above.
